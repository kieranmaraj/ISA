# Newkin

## Run
To run, add this directory to the Max search path. Open the nk.wacomBroadcast (if using a Wacom) and newkin-kieran_maraj_5071_A5 patches. The wacom broadcast is in a separate patch as I can only get the s2m.wacom object to function properly in Max 7 on my system.

## Dependencies (included)
- s2m.wacom 
- s2m.wacomtouch
- ml.som
- ml.mlp
- dot.mean.sliding
- dot.mean.exponential
- dot.median.sliding
- cm.buffercloud~
- odot
- modosc
- dispersion.timebang

Also requires Mubu to be installed via package manager
